# Self-Driving Car Simulation using JavaScript

This project demonstrates the simulation of a **Self-Driving Car** using JavaScript. The simulation integrates **sensors**, **AI algorithms**, and **virtual environments** to mimic real-world driving scenarios, allowing the car to navigate autonomously without human intervention. This project showcases how JavaScript can be utilized in the development of advanced algorithms for autonomous vehicle perception, decision-making, and control.

## Features:
- **Sensor Integration**: Uses cameras, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors for environmental perception.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: Implements algorithms for object detection, path planning, and behavior prediction to simulate the decision-making process in self-driving cars.
- **Virtual Environment Simulation**: A digital realm created to replicate various road conditions, traffic situations, and weather scenarios, providing a safe and controlled space for testing self-driving algorithms.
- **Control System**: Autonomous control of acceleration, braking, and steering based on sensor input and AI-driven decisions.
- **Testing Results**: Evaluation of the car's performance in terms of lane following, traffic sign recognition, obstacle avoidance, and reaction to different road markings.

## Components:
- **Perception**: Object detection and environment modeling through sensor fusion.
- **Decision Making**: Path planning and behavior prediction.
- **Integration**: Real-time communication between hardware and software components for smooth vehicle control.
- **Simulation**: Virtual testing environments for scenario generation, testing, and validation of algorithms.

## Getting Started:
To run the simulation locally, clone this repository and open the HTML file in your browser. Ensure that you have a modern browser that supports JavaScript and the Web APIs used in the project.

```

## Future Work:
- **Weather Simulation**: Enhancing the simulation to include diverse weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog.
- **Advanced Traffic Scenarios**: Improving the simulation to handle more complex traffic conditions such as merging lanes and heavy congestion.
- **Enhanced AI Models**: Incorporating more sophisticated machine learning models for better decision-making and control.
